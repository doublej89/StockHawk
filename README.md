# StockHawk

StockHawk is a simple stock tracking app. Upon launch it displays a list of a limited number of 
stock quotes. The quotes are updated every hour.

If any of the list items are tapped, a line chart appears showing the hour by hour evolution of 
price of the particular stock.

Tapping on the floating action button on the main page prompts the user to enter a stock symbol
which, if not already present in the database, will be added to the database and displayed in the
list along with its price, percentage change, etc.

A widget is also available for this app, which displays a list of the same stock quotes as in the
main app. The list items also display the same on click behavior as in th main app.
