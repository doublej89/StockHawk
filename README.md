# StockHawk

StockHawk is a stock tracking app. Upon launch it displays a list of a limited number of 
stock quotes. The quotes are updated every hour.

If any of the list items are tapped, a line chart appears showing the hour by hour evolution of 
price of the particular stock.

The floating action button allows the user to add valid stock quotes to be tracked

A widget is also available for this app, which displays a list of the same stock quotes as in the
main app. The list items also display the same on click behavior as in th main app.
